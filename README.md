This project is a machine learning application using Apache Spark ML.

Please first download and install Apache Spark by following the instructions on this [website](https://spark.apache.org/news/spark-2-3-0-released.html)

After the installation, you need to update the path in "util.py" and "" by first searching the keyword "spark_submit_location" and replace that line with this:
```
spark_submit_location = '/home/rwu/Desktop/spark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit'
```

Here, "/home/rwu/Desktop/spark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit" should be the spark-submit path.

The sample data is stored in the folder "data". "prms_input.csv" is for Case Study 1. "1.csv" and "2.csv" are for Case Study 2. These files are generated by the hydrologic models for the streamflow predictions.

#Quick Start
First create a virtual environment
```
mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 dev
```

If you have created the virtual environment, then use this commend to enter it
```
virtualenv dev && source dev/bin/activate
```

Here is the command to install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Here is the command to run the program
```
python test_TD_machine_learning_recursive_training_bound_transform.py
```
Here is the command to visualize the results
```
python vis_rmse_all_results.py 
```
